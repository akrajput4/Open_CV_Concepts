Daily Python Learning: OpenCV Concepts
Welcome to the "Daily Python Learning: OpenCV Concepts" repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning OpenCV in Python, where I’ll be posting daily challenges, exercises, and concepts related to image processing, computer vision, and OpenCV.

Each day, I'll be exploring different topics, ranging from basic image manipulation to advanced computer vision techniques, and sharing my learnings in the form of Python code, explanations, and visual results. This repo serves both as a personal learning journal and a resource for anyone who is also diving into OpenCV and Python for computer vision.

Topics Covered:
Image manipulation (reading, displaying, and saving images)
Image transformations (scaling, rotating, and cropping)
Drawing on images (shapes, lines, text)
Filters and edge detection
Object detection and tracking
Machine learning applications in OpenCV
And much more!
Feel free to explore, contribute, or ask questions as I continue my learning journey with OpenCV in Python. Let’s learn and grow together!
