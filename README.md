# Daily Python Learning: OpenCV Concepts

Welcome to my **Daily Python Learning: OpenCV Concepts** repository!  
This repo is a collection of my daily experiments and learning in the field of **OpenCV** and **computer vision** using Python.

Every day, I dive into a new concept or technique related to OpenCV, from basic image processing to advanced computer vision topics. I document my learning through practical code examples, exercises, and visual results.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Image manipulation (loading, displaying, saving images)
- Image transformations (scaling, rotating, cropping)
- Drawing on images (shapes, lines, text)
- Filters and edge detection
- Object detection and tracking
- Machine learning applications with OpenCV
- And more...

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daily-python-opencv.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the folder of the specific day you're interested in.
3. Run the Python scripts to see the code in action.

## 🤝 Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository, submit issues, or make pull requests with your own OpenCV projects and ideas. Contributions are always welcome!

Let's learn together and make OpenCV even more fun! 😄
